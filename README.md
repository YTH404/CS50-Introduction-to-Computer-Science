This repository documents my ongoing journey through **CS50x**, Harvard University's renowned introduction to computer science course.
I’m uploading solutions progressively, problem set by problem set, to showcase both my learning process and completed work.

## 📚 Progress Tracker
- [ ] Problem Set 1 – C (hello, mario, cash, credit)
- [ ] Problem Set 2 – Arrays (readability, caesar, substitution)
- [ ] Problem Set 3 – Algorithms (plurality, runoff, tideman)
- [ ] Problem Set 4 – Memory (filter, recover)
- [ ] Problem Set 5 – Data Structures (speller)
- [ ] Problem Set 6 – Python (hello, mario, readability, DNA)
- [ ] Problem Set 7 – SQL (movies, fiftyville)
- [ ] Problem Set 8 – Web (homepage, finance)
- [ ] Problem Set 9 – Final Project

## 🛠️ Languages & Tools
- **C** (early problem sets)
- **Python** (later problem sets)
- **SQL** (databases)
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (web development)
- **CS50 IDE / VS Code / GitHub**

## 🎯 Purpose
- Track my progress through CS50x
- Demonstrate problem-solving skills in multiple languages
- Build a portfolio of projects that reflect my growth in computer science
